iBeacon Transmitter
===================

This app aggregates signal data from iBeacons and uploads it to a server for ongoing processing. This is intended as
a development PoC, and as such is not that configurable. The intention is that real-time updates can be sent when new
beacons are detected or change proximity, and batched updates about more holistic iBeacon behaviour can be sent
periodically so a profile of iBeacon "journeys" can be captured.
